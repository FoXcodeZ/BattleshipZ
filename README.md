## How to run this game?

### Option 1:
Simply open this project in your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) and run it.

### Option 2:
Go to the folder: ``BattleshipZ/out/artifacts/`` and run a terminal.

In a terminal (that supports ASCII codes), execute: `java -jar BattleshipZ.jar`.


==IMPORTANT==
``Your terminal must support ASCII codes as this game utilizes them for coloured text.``


## How to play?
It's a simple, well-known version of the [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game. In the console version, you need to specify which field you want to hit. For example, you can enter `a4` or `C2`.
